### Access
You agree and understand that you are not allowed to enter any restricted area of any computer or network of Arcana under any circumstances or perform any functions that are not authorised by these Terms.

## THE SERVICE

Arcana Network is a comprehensive stack of interoperable software tools designed to help developers build decentralized applications, with its own sovereign blockchain maintained by validators and network actors, and focuses on security and privacy. Third-party developers and users will be able to utilise these software tools to build applications from scratch or integrate specific functionalities with their own projects.

Arcana Network privacy stack has four fundamental offerings:

### Arcana Wallet
Arcana Wallet is a decentralised non-custodial blockchain identity wallet for users to store, and engage in transactions relating to digital assets. It is visualised on a secure Ethereum provider interface for blockchain file access transaction sign/approval by dApp, allowing social OAuth and passwordless authentication for dApps, file data encryption/decryption, distributed key generation for dApps.

### Arcana Store
Arcana Store is a distributed, secure, and private storage system that allows dApp users to upload or download file data or NFT. It relies on a network of storage nodes, which are independent entities that deploy custom Arcana software for offering storage infrastructure and functions such as providing storage for encrypted ﬁle shares, providing necessary storage bandwidth when encrypted ﬁle shares are requested by clients, deallocate associated storage when encrypted ﬁle shares are deleted by clients, and participate in Arcana Proof of Replication (PoRep) scheme and submit timely proofs when challenged.

### Arcana Access
Arcana Access is a protocol which enables complete data ownership and privacy for dApp users through blockchain-powered, user-approved/signed file access actions such as sharing, revoking, transferring ownership, or deleting a file.

### Arcana Auth
Arcana Auth aims to provide developers with a decentralized, non-custodial public key infrastructure(PKI), allowing dApp users to claim a public-private key pair. This enables social OAuth and passwordless authentication for dApps and distributed key generation for signing blockchain transactions. Developers can choose from a variety of OAuth-based user signup options like Gmail, Facebook, Twitter and even custom OAuth-based signup schemes.

### Non-custodial nature of smart contracts
When you access certain features of the software tools, the user interface will allow you to access a non-custodial smart contract to perform a variety of transactions. In particular, you confirm that all actions and functions performed via the Arcana smart contract are irrevocable. You remain in full control of your digital assets, which are not held or controlled in any way by Garoutech. Garoutech does not collect or hold your keys or information - accordingly, if you lose control over these assets, Garoutech cannot access your digital assets; digital backups; recover keys, passwords, or other information; reset passwords; or reverse transactions. You are solely responsible for the safety of your digital assets and your use of the Services, including without limitation for storing, backing up, and maintaining the confidentiality of your private keys, passwords, and information, and for the security of any transactions you perform using the Website. You expressly relieve and release Garoutech from any and all liability and/or loss arising from your use of the Services.

### Service fees
If you elect to utilise the Services, all transactions will be conducted solely through the relevant blockchain network. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Website, or using the smart contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the relevant blockchain network.

The relevant blockchain network typically requires the payment of a transaction fee ("**Gas Fee**") for every transaction that occurs on the relevant blockchain network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralised network. This means that you may need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Website.

You also may be subject to certain additional fees and commissions, including fees for utilising certain Services, as notified to you prior to performing any transaction thereon or otherwise interacting with Arcana or the smart contracts. Garoutech also reserves the right to levy additional fees for access via the smart contracts, the Site or the Website in the future. You agree to promptly pay all aforementioned fees and commissions.

### Not an Offering of Banking business, Trust business, Custodial business, Escrow business, Securities or Commodities
You understand and affirm that Garoutech is a non-custodial provider of technical smart-contract services which allow users to manage their digital assets. The content of the Website and the Services do not constitute any banking business, trust business, custodial business, escrow business, any offer to buy or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell investments, securities, partnership interests, commodities or any other financial instruments in any jurisdiction. The content or the Website and the Services also do not constitute, and may not be used for or in connection with, an offer or solicitation by anyone in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorized or permitted, or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. In particular, the Services do not constitute any "banking business" within the meaning of any banking laws, "custody" within the meaning of any virtual assets law, or "capital markets products" or "securities" within the meaning of any securities law.

### No Advice
Garoutech makes no representation or warranty, express or implied, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, regarding the advisability of participating in digital assets on any blockchain, any financial products, securities, funds, commodity interests, partnership interests or other investments or funding or purchasing loans. Garoutech is merely a technology service provider allowing you to manage your own digital assets connecting you with various third parties and does not offer fiduciary services, and is not your agent, trustee, advisor or fiduciary.

### Non-reliance
The Services and the Arcana software tools allow users to create a variety of applications. It is solely your responsibility to determine the legality of the applications created and the legal relationship created between you and your end user in respect of such developed applications/users services. Garoutech provides no guarantees as to the suitability or legality of the Services or software tools.

### Taxes
It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any interest received through the Services, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of tax to the appropriate tax authorities.

### Amendment or Withdrawal of Services
Garoutech may impose additional terms for the usage of the Service, as set forth in separate Service-specific Terms and Conditions. Garoutech may increase or restrict the scope of Services, and may modify, limit or discontinue existing Services, from time to time and at Garoutech 's sole discretion.

## RISK FACTORS

You acknowledge and agree that the Services are is currently in the initial development stages and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks with utilising the Services or Website. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of your digital assets associated with the Services. **IF YOU DECIDE TO UTILISE SERVICES YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE BELOW RISKS AND AGREE NOT TO HOLD GAROUTECH OR ANY OF THEIR RELATED PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING RISKS**:

### Third-party Risk
The Services rely on whole or partly, on third-party open and closed source software networks, and the continued development and support of third parties. There is no assurance or guarantee that those third parties will maintain their support of their software, which might have a material adverse effect on the Services. Further, where digital assets locked as collateral for deAssets are deployed by the protocol towards third-party decentralized finance protocols to further generate yield, a failure or security incident in respect of such third-party protocol may result in users losing all or substantially all of their digital assets.

### No Insurance
Digital assets are not legal tender, are not backed by the government, and are not subject to the Deposit Insurance Scheme or protections under any banking or securities laws. Garoutech is not a bank and does not offer fiduciary services, nor does it offer any security brokering services.

### New Technical Risk
The Arcana software used for Arcana is new. While this software has been extensively tested, the software used for the Services is still relatively new and could have bugs or security vulnerabilities. Further, the software is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time that may not meet users’ expectations.

### Risks
The underlying smart contracts run on a variety of supported blockchain networks, using specially-developed smart contracts. Accordingly, upgrades to the relevant blockchain network, a hard fork in the relevant blockchain network, re-organisations of blockchain structure or blocks, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the relevant blockchain network may have unintended, adverse effects on the smart contracts built thereon, including Arcana software and smart contracts.

### Information Security Risk
Digital assets, and use of the Services may be subject to expropriation and/or theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Services in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the underlying blockchain networks comprise open-source software, there is the software underlying the Services may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses that may negatively affect the Services or result in the loss of the user’s digital assets, the loss of the user’s ability to access or control their digital assets. In the event of such a software bug or weakness, there may be no remedy, and users are not guaranteed any remedy, refund or compensation.

### Regulatory risks
The regulatory status of digital assets, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. While every effort has been taken to ensure that the Services are compliant with local laws, it is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to the Services. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Services. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Arcana in various ways, and thus the Services may not be available in certain areas.

### Taxation Risk
The tax characterization of digital assets, and the usage of the Services are uncertain. It is possible that the user's intended treatment of digital assets may be challenged. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with the Services provided by Arcana, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value-added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.

### Dispute Resolution
**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS CERTAIN PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION SECTION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH GAROUTECH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US**.
Each party (i) waives all its respective right(s) to have any and all disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, "**Disputes**") arising from or related to these Terms resolved in a court, and (ii) waive all its respective right(s) to have any Disputes heard before a court. Instead, each party shall arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration, and in no circumstances shall be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an entity attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.

Any Dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms (including without limitation the enforceability of this section or any question regarding its existence, validity or termination) shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this section 8. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The tribunal shall consist of 1 arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English.

Each party will notify the other party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the Parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Garoutech shall be sent by e-mail to Garoutech at compliance@arcana.network. Notice to you shall be either posted on the Website or, if available, will be sent by email to your email on record. Your notice must include (i) your name, postal address, email address and telephone number, (ii) a full and sufficient description of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (iii) the specific relief that you are seeking. If you and Garoutech cannot agree on how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date the notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Garoutech may, as appropriate and in accordance with this section, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in this section, file a claim in court.

The arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

If any term, clause or provision of this section is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be held to the minimum extent applicable and required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this section will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in this section are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

You agree that this section of these Terms has been included to rapidly and inexpensively resolve any disputes with respect to the matters described herein, and that this section shall be grounds for dismissal of any court action commenced by you with respect to a dispute arising out of such matters.

A printed version of these Terms shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings.

These Terms shall be binding and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, our successors, and permitted assigns.

### No-Waiver

Except for the indemnity and exculpation provisions herein, nothing expressed in, mentioned in, or implied from these Terms is intended or shall be construed to give any person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim under or in respect to these Terms to enforce any of its terms which might otherwise be interpreted to confer such rights to such persons, and these Terms and all representations, warranties, covenants, conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be and are for the exclusive benefit of you and us.
