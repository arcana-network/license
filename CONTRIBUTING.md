### General Guidelines

* Every contribution must be associated with an open GitHub issue.

* Before you report an issue, please refer to the list of open issues for the Arcana Network SDKs. Refer to the SDK repository Issues section at [GitHub](https://github.com/arcana-network).

* If you do not see the issue already reported in the list of open issues, raise a new one. Use the GitHub issue template and fill in all the required details about the issue that you are facing. Provide screenshots and steps to reproduce it for a speedy investigation and redressal by Arcana Network developers and other community enthusiasts.

* Pull Requests (PR) are most welcome as contributions.

  - If you plan to submit a pull request, first raise an issue and assign it to yourself. Describe what you plan to provide / add or change in your PR. It could be a feature, an optimization or plugging in a security vulnerability or privacy issue.  
  - For a complex or larger change, we highly recommend that you first discuss with the core Arcana development team members and then implement it.
  - Make sure that you fork the SDK repository, fix the issue in your fork, test it and commit it. Only then, issue a PR.
  - It is expected that you will **follow the coding styles, testing processes specific to respective Arcana Network SDK repository** and **not deviate from the existing code writing style** unless there is a good reason for it.
  - Add new test cases to automate testing your PR changes during CI cycles and to ensure nothing breaks in earlier functionality due to the changes that you introduced.
  - Refer to the SDK Quick Start, Usage and Reference Guides available at [Arcana Network Documentation Website](http://docs.beta.arcana.network/)
  - Please make sure you provide all the details in the pull request template regarding the issue you fixed and the approach that was taken for solving it.
  - We will review all PRs raised by any contributor and revert back if further action is needed on their part.
  - Once approved, a PR will be merged into the Arcana Network SDK repository **dev** branch in the code base.  The updates will be merged and released from the main branch as per Arcana Network validation and release cycles / plans and product management priorities.

* For complex issues, or if you are not sure about an issue that you are facing, and would like to discuss it first, feel free to [drop us an email](mailto://support@arcana.network).

* You can also check out [Arcana Forum](https://forum.arcana.network/), [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/w6ej4FtqYS) for any related discussions that might help you get unblocked while using Arcana Network SDKs.
