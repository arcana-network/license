By accessing the website at [https://arcana.network/](https://arcana.network/) (the **Website**), you agree and consent to Arcana (the **Company**), its related corporations, business units and affiliates, as well as their respective representatives and/or agents (collectively referred to herein as Arcana, using, disclosing and sharing amongst themselves the personal data, and to disclosing such personal data to relevant third-party providers. This Policy supplements but does not supersede nor replace any other consent which you may have previously provided to us nor does it affect any rights that we may have at law in connection with the collection, use and/or disclosure of your personal data. We may from time to time update this Policy to ensure that this Policy is consistent with our future developments, industry trends and/or any changes in legal or regulatory requirements. Subject to your rights at law, the prevailing terms of this Policy shall apply. For the avoidance of doubt, this Policy forms part of the terms and conditions governing your relationship with us and should be read in conjunction with such terms and conditions.

This Policy describes how Arcana may collect, use, disclose, process and manage your personal data, and applies to any individual’s personal data which is in our possession or under our control.

1. **What personal data is collected by Arcana?**

   “Personal data” means data, whether true or not, about an individual who can be identified (i) from that data, or (ii) from that data and other information to which the organisation has or is likely to have access. Some examples of personal data that Arcana may collect are:

   (a) personal particulars (e.g., name, contact details, residential address, date of birth, identity card/passport details, social media handles and other social media profile information, and/or education details);

   (b) financial details (e.g., income, expenses, credit history and/or credit card and bank information);

   (c) images and voice recordings of our conversations with you, whether from our events or office surveillances or otherwise;

   (d) work experience and employment details (e.g., occupation, directorships and other positions held, employment history, salary, and/or benefits);

   (e) tax and insurance information;

   (f) information about your use of our services and Website;

   (g) usernames and password, third party account credentials (such as your Facebook login credentials, Google login credentials) and IP address;

   (h) banking information (e.g., account numbers and banking transactions);

   (i) private or public cryptographic key relating to addresses on distributed ledger networks and/or similar information; and/or

   (j) personal opinions made known to us (e.g., feedback or responses to surveys).

   Personal data may be collected when you interact with our services or use the Website, or may be received by Arcana from third-party databases or service providers that provide business information.

2. **Collection of Data**: Your data is collected either directly from you, or offline/online, including through the Platform. The data compromises of:

   (i) **Personal Data:** We may ask for data related to your identification that can be used to contact or identify you (“**Personal Data**”). Personal Data will include, among others, your name, profile picture, email address, phone number, payment card details, virtual currency accounts, royalties and fees, login data etc.

   (ii) **Usage Data**: We may collect information about how you use the Platform, the Services and other offerings made available by us ("**Usage Data**"), including your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.

   (iii) **Tracking Cookies Data**: We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies on our Platform to store your information/preferences. You can refuse to accept any cookies, but in such a case you may not be able to use a certain portion of the Services or Platform.

3. **Personal data and the Blockchain**

   **3.1**  Blockchain technology, also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), is at the core of our business. Blockchains are decentralized and made up of digitally recorded data in a chain of packages called "blocks". The manner in which these blocks are linked is chronological, meaning that the data is very difficult to alter once recorded. Since the ledger may be distributed all over the world (across several "nodes" which usually replicate the ledger) this means there is no single person making decisions or otherwise administering the system (such as an operator of a cloud computing system), and that there is no centralized place where it is located either.

   Accordingly, by design, a blockchain’s data cannot be changed or deleted and is said to be "immutable". This may affect your ability to exercise your rights such as your right to erasure ("right to be forgotten"), or your rights to object or restrict processing of your personal data. Data on the blockchain cannot be erased and cannot be changed. Although smart contracts may be used to revoke certain access rights, and some content may be made invisible to others, it is not deleted.

   **3.2** In certain circumstances, in order to comply with our contractual obligations to you (such as delivery of tokens or provision of other Services) it will be necessary to collect certain personal data, such as your wallet address, onto the blockchain; this is done through a smart contract and requires you to execute such transactions using your wallet’s private key.

   **3.3** The ultimate decisions to (a) transact on the blockchain using your wallet address, as well as (b) share the public key relating to your wallet address with anyone (including us) rests with you. IF YOU WANT TO ENSURE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE NOT AFFECTED IN ANY WAY, YOU SHOULD NOT TRANSACT ON BLOCKCHAINS AS CERTAIN RIGHTS MAY NOT BE FULLY AVAILABLE OR EXERCISABLE BY YOU OR US DUE TO THE TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE BLOCKCHAIN. IN PARTICULAR THE BLOCKCHAIN IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND ANY PERSONAL DATA SHARED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN WILL BECOME PUBLICLY AVAILABLE.

4. **Disclosure** **of Data**:
